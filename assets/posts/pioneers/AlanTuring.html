                <strong>Alan Mathison Turing</strong> was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of 
                theoretical computer science, providing a formalization of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. He is widely 
                regarded as the <i>Father of Theoretical Computer Science</i>.

            <h3 class="pioneers">Background</h3>
            <p>
                He graduated in math from King's College, Cambridge in 1934. Between the springs of 1935 and 1936, at the same time as Church, Turing worked on the decidability of problems. On 28 May of 1936, he finished and delivered his 36-page paper for publication called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Computable_Numbers,_with_an_Application_to_the_Entscheidungsproblem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem</a>". This paper has been called "easily the most influential math paper in history". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John von Neumann</a> acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing's paper. To this day, Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation.

            <p>
                In June 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton; his dissertation, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals, introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing, in which Turing machines are augmented with so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oracles</a>, allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by Turing machines. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In September 1939 Great Britain went to war against Germany. During the war, Turing worked at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park. Turing and others designed a code-breaking machine known as the Bombe. They used the Bombe to learn German military secrets. At the end of the war, Turing was made an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.

            <p>
                In 1948, Turing was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. A year later, he became deputy director of the Computing Machine Laboratory, where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computersâ€”the Manchester Mark 1. During this time, he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics, and in a paper "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computing Machinery and Intelligence</a>", Turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence, and proposed an experiment that became known as the Turing test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called "intelligent". 
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1948, Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.G._Champernowne" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D.G. Champernowne</a>, began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950, the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp.When Turing was 39 years old in 1951, he turned to mathematical biology, finally publishing his masterpiece "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chemical_Basis_of_Morphogenesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis</a>" in January 1952. One of the early applications of Turing's paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats, large and small.
